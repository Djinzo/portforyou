## Here we go Again !!

First collaboration between PikenBower Clan members,

first of all, migrate to `pnpm` instead of `yarn`:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

to run in your local:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` to run
`pnpm build` to build
`pnpm format` to format the entire project
`pnpm lint` to check esl.int rules
`pnpm lint:fix` to fix eslint problems

Here we go Again !!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Happy coding ðŸ’» ðŸ˜œ
